Hi, I'm Shraddha! ðŸ‘‹

A backend engineer working on databases and distributed systems. I currently work on [Ceph](https://ceph.io/) at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com), part of the core team responsible for enhancing and maintaining RADOS. I also [write](https://www.shraddhaag.dev/writing) and [speak](https://www.shraddhaag.dev/talks) occasionally about the work I am doing.

I am focused on writing software that isnâ€™t a pain in the ass for the next person who works with it or rather less crudely put, is well tested, documented and observable. I believe user empathy is an important consideration while designing APIs. I try to stay away from premature optimisation and consider writing documentation as important as development.

I mainly work with C++ these days. Before this, I primarily worked with Golang, briefly explored Rust and have Python experience. 

[shraddhaag.dev](https://www.shraddhaag.dev) is my home on the internet. You can reach out to me on mail <a href="mailto:contact@shraddhaag.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">contact@shraddhaag.dev</a> or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shraddhaag)! 

## Challenges 

Since late last year, I have discovered the joy of solving coding challenges with a strong community presense. 

* [aoc](https://github.com/shraddhaag/aoc) - Solution to Advent of Code 2023 in Golang. 
* [1brc](https://github.com/shraddhaag/1brc) - My take on the One Billion Rows Challenge. 

If you know about more challenges that I should try, please write to me! 

## Write 

I believe writing cements understanding and boosts clarity. Some of my select posts: 

* [One Billion Rows Challenge in Golang](https://www.bytesizego.com/blog/one-billion-row-challenge-go) - [The Primeagen](https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen) walked through the post on his [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYng524S-MA)! 
* [Improving Teuthology Scheduling: GSoC 2020 with Ceph Foundation](https://www.shraddhaag.dev/posts/gsoc-2020-with-ceph).
